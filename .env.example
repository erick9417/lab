# Local development API base (used by Vite dev proxy)
# This proxies /api/* requests to the backend during development, avoiding CORS
# Example: VITE_DEV_API=http://localhost:3000
VITE_DEV_API=

# Production API base (optional)
# Use this if your frontend is NOT served under the same domain as the API
# Example: VITE_API_BASE=https://api.tu-dominio.com
# If serving frontend and backend under same domain (with reverse proxy), leave empty
